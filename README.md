## How To Play?

This is a maze game. You will play as a polar bear and avoid being hunted down by Qin Shi Huang.

By the way, the maze will generate randomly.

The initial difficulty of this game is normal. If you think it is too easy, you can set it to difficult before the game starts.

To control the polar bear, use the up, down, left and right buttons to control it.

There are some props in the maze that can be picked up, and the effects take effect immediately. They all have a duration that varies depending on the difficulty.

### Item 1 : Thorn Sword

note : Note: Whenever Qin Shi Huang is killed, his speed will increase by two.
